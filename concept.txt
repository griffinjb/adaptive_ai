Multiplayer game
	
Objective:

	Map domination

	Eliminate the other player and all of their clones.

The player may clone themselves.

Clones cost money.

Clones learn from the player that spawns them.

Clone learns from player until spawned.

Then, it learns from adversaries.

If an enemy faction defeats a clone, they convert it.

Money is acquired via... Conversions. Harvesting. 

Checkpoints allow a user to bank their cash.

Money can buy AI features that improve learning.

Mana System

Health System

Simple environment, yet deep gameplay.

Spenny, any aesthetic input?

Finite Resources limits clones, limits training time.

	Scale of the game limited by computation resources.

network consolidation

Constraints on the map allow for a higher collision probability

A generative algorithm is a random number generator.

Now we generate random traversals of the random state space.

But what if the generator has strong structural patterns.

Such as spatial correlation, or time correlation.

What of emergent correlation? / Fractal or genetic similarity

This is kind of a simulation game.

Or ancestor simulation as they say.

They grow more like themselves over time.

And their traits define their performance.

Yet the weak perish!

So the strong prevail.

As you pan out, you shift roles from tunneller to evolutionary architect.

You spend collected mana on upgrades
