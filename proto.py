# Simple Prototype to test things out.

# player moves on grid
	# with WASD


	# Percieves radial grid sampling of continuous env. ?

# we can use pygame for this.

import numpy as np 
# import pygame as pg 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 



# timer, and stochasticity

# probability of doing a thing per time given state



# actually we can do both.

	# haha i'm lit rip> :)

# When action is made, 
# capture the time diff.

# use those inactions as training samples.


# then use the density and update the other guy based on the stats


# most basic: make game board 



# N = 16

# P0 = [0,0]

# abundance = .1

# S = np.floor(np.random.uniform(0,1,[N,N]) + abundance)

# plt.imshow(S)

# plt.show()


# so what's the flow ?

while 1:

	# hang on user, AI, opponent

	# When someone does something,
		# Launch sub process, training
	
	# for a discrete percept space,
		# We want the conditional density of action	
			# discrete action

	# so estimate conditional density of each, via observation?

	# kinda problematic... permutations are ouch. 

	# so need to make feature?
